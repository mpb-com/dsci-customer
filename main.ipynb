    "\n",
    "The aim of ‘propensity to lapse’ is to understand who in our customer base is ‘active’, ‘lapsing’ or ‘lost’. This enables us to communicate differently to customers with these different attributes. The propensity to lapse output needs to be calculated at an individual level as opposed to at group level. The output should be a **single categorical value against each customer record.**\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been agreed with stakeholders that **two** segmentations will be created serving different use cases\n",
    "* Transactional - focussing exclusively on propensity to lapse in the transactional context\n",
    "* Behavioural - platform based engagement\n"
